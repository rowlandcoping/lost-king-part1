### 1) Project Goals

The goal of The Lost King is to provide users with an immersive and interactive role-playing experience. 
Whilst the game will be predominantly story driven, it is anticipated that the decisions the player makes will matter 
and extend beyond simple choices (eg go left, go right) to decisions that also have a moral dimension which will influence 
other aspects of the game.

These decisions will lead to different story paths, encounters and ultimate game outcomes. Athough the MVP will be driven to a large 
degree by random chance, it is anticipated that the way player actions influence these odds could have a decisive effect on their 
journey through the game.  As the first game (and indeed the series) develops it is envisaged that additional layers of interactivity 
can be added for deeper player engagement and replayability; ultimately there is the potential for social sharing and perhaps even monetisation.

it is envisaged that the game will be played by either gamers, particularly those with an interest in the RPG genre, 
or office workers with too much time on their hands. As such the majority will likely be accessing it via laptop or desktop, 
and sharing it via social channels like Discord and Slack or, in the office environment, via e-mail.

### 2) Developer Goals

- Build portfolio: I want this project to display originality as well as a wow factor which will make it stand out from the crowd and proide value for users.
- Enjoy the process: Part of the reason I chose this project is I think it will be a lot of fun to build.
- Develop technical skills:  As my first project using JavaScript, I want to deploy range of techniques to further my skills.
- Extensibility:  The MVP for this project could potentially be very simple, but there is also a great deal of scope to add extra features, either as part of this project or in the future.

### 3) Site Owner - User Stories

As a developer and the ultimate site owner, I have a clear vision of what I want this project to achieve and who is likely to be using the website.

- Initial Engagement: On landing there has to be a strong theme, engaging visuals and an intuitive UI to encourage users to stay and play the game.
- Story Led:  There needs to be a well written branching narrative which keeps people engaged to the end of the story.
- Humour and the 4th Wall:  Because of the audience I would like to keep the tone quite light (particularly when things go wrong) and introduce moments of humour as well as 4th wall comments.
- Interactive decisions:  This does not just mean offering decisions, but also that the decisions need to have a genuine impact on gameplay.
- Replayability:  This comes from two facets - one is multiple possible outcomes derived from user decisions, and the other is in making the gameplay fair.  
You don't want it to be a simple grind to an unfair death and a closed browser window.
- User friendly interface:  This amounts to a list of personal bugbears, but includes pop-up windows and alerts, 
unfathomable error messages (or even any error messages), over-elaborate sign-ins, two setp sign-ins, and automated actions.  The user should have full control over their journey in the medium the have chosen to access it (ie the browser windwow).
- Interactive combat: Combat should be balanced where it occurs, and led by player decisions.

### 4) Site Visitor - User Stories

It is envisaged that the game will be played by either gamers, particularly those with an interest in the RPG genre, 
or office workers with too much time on their hands. As such the majority will likely be accessing it via laptop or desktop, 
and sharing it via social channels like Discord and Slack or, in the office environment, via e-mail.

- Instant Access:  Office users in particular want to be able to click a button and get stuck in during their lunchbreak, without lots of interim steps
- Character Creation:  Conversely, those with an interest in RPG games generally might like to have some input in this side of things
- Attractive/retro visuals: People want a visual and user engagement experience that adds value from the off. There is a huge appetite for retro gaming these days. 
- Low attention span:  It's unlikely the majority of users will have time for a wall of text. Things will have to be to the point. There are so many other things they could be wasting their time on!
- Make a difference:  users will want plenty of opportunities to influence gameplay, without having to micromanage.  They are lazy, but they like to be in control.
- Be treated like adults:  It's unlikely to be teenagers playing this game.  So there does not need to be too much hand-holding.
- This time next Tuesday: Provide replayability, through a process of discovery and through dividing paths.  Offer new and amusing ways to die.
- Brief but glorious:  This is a lunchbreak/codebreak thing, and there will be no save game function, so it needs to be over relatively quickly.
